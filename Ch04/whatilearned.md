# What I Learned

## Crypto

- A code replaces whole words with whole words. A cipher replaces or scrambles letters
- Transposition cipher scrambles arrangement of letters or words rather than replacing the letters.

## Python

- A good exmaple of how to document code where users will be opening up the code to run it. (Possible with languages like Python, Ruby, etc) - see route_cipher_decrypt.py
