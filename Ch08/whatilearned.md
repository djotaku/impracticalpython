# What I learned

## Haiku/Syllable Counting

## Python

- The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK  - pip install nltk) - programs for working with human language in Python
- the cmudict has a dictionary containing word phonemes
- dictionary_name.pop(variable, None) - by adding the None parameter there won't be a KeyError if the user enters a word not in the dict
