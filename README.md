# impracticalpython
My solutions to coding projects in the Impractical Python book. 

I'm using this repo to save the code I create while going through the Impractical Python book. For the book's examples, my code'll 
basically be the same as the author's. But for the practice and challenge code I'll be doing it on my own and you'll get to see some 
unique code. 

Why am I doing this? To learn some new Python tricks via off the wall projects.
